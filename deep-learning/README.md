# Deep Learning Projects

This folder contains applied deep learning projects, with an emphasis on **system-level thinking**, not just model training.

Projects focus on:
- Problem framing
- Model architecture choices
- Training and evaluation
- Interpretability and deployment considerations

### Topics Covered
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer learning
- Model explainability
- Handling limited or imbalanced data

### Typical Tools
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Torchvision / Keras
- GPU-aware training workflows

The goal is to demonstrate practical deep learning skills aligned with real-world constraints.
