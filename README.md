# data-science-portfolio
This repository showcases **end-to-end, production-style data science projects** focused on solving real business problems using machine learning, forecasting, experimentation, deep learning, and modern AI systems.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate **Data Scientist II–level capability**:
- Translating business problems into data science solutions
- Building and evaluating models beyond accuracy
- Designing experiments and forecasting systems
- Applying deep learning and LLM-based architectures
- Writing clean, modular, and reproducible code

---

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Applied machine learning (classification & forecasting)
- Experiment design and A/B testing
- Deep learning systems (CNNs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI agents with tool use and reasoning
- Model evaluation, tradeoffs, and business impact
- Engineering best practices (pipelines, modularity, documentation)
