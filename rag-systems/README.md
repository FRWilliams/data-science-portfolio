# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

This folder contains projects that combine **information retrieval with large language models** to build reliable AI-powered applications.

Projects emphasize:
- Retrieval quality over raw generation
- Architecture design
- Evaluation and grounding
- Source attribution

### Topics Covered
- Document ingestion and chunking
- Vector databases and similarity search
- Hybrid retrieval strategies
- LLM orchestration
- Answer relevance and hallucination mitigation

### Typical Tools
- Vector databases (FAISS, Chroma, etc.)
- Embedding models
- LLM APIs
- Python-based pipelines

These projects demonstrate modern applied AI system design.
