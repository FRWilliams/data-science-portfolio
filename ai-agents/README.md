- Autonomous decision-making
- Tool use and orchestration
- Guardrails and control
- Practical applications in analytics and ML

### Topics Covered
- Planner–executor architectures
- Tool calling
- Data analysis agents
- Monitoring and alerting agents
- Reasoning and memory patterns

### Typical Tools
- LLM APIs
- Python
- Structured prompts and schemas
- Evaluation and safety mechanisms

The emphasis is on **reliable, controlled agents**, not demos.
