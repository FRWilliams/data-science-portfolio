# Forecasting & Time Series Projects

This folder focuses on **forecasting problems and time series analysis**, with an emphasis on validation rigor and business relevance.

Projects demonstrate how to:
- Model temporal data correctly
- Evaluate forecasts using rolling validation
- Communicate uncertainty and risk
- Compare classical and machine learning approaches

### Topics Covered
- Revenue and demand forecasting
- Time series cross-validation
- Forecast intervals and uncertainty
- Seasonality and trend decomposition
- Scenario analysis

### Typical Tools
- Statsmodels (ARIMA / SARIMAX)
- Prophet
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost with lag features
- Pandas time series utilities

The goal is to show forecasting as a **decision-support system**, not just curve fitting.
